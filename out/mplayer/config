#The config file should be empty or contain the line: ss-out-dir="DIRECTORY"    
#DIRECTORY is the desired output location of your screenshots, and should be    
#double quoted as shown.  This is the only option available.  The screenshot    
#directory defaults to "~" if the config file is empty or if DIRECTORY is not    
#specified.  If this option is specified multiple times, the last one listed    
#will be the screenshot directory.  Comments are allowed and are denoted by    
#the "#" symbol.  Options for mplayer should be placed in the mplayer config    
#file, usually "~/.mplayer/config".
